# Murmur

Push-to-talk dictation for Windows. Hold a key in any app, speak, release, and clean formatted text lands at your cursor. It is a from-scratch Windows answer to Wispr Flow, built to share: clone it, install, paste a free API key, and you are dictating in under five minutes.

## What it does

- **Hold to talk**: hold Right Ctrl (rebindable), speak, release to insert. There is also a toggle shortcut (Ctrl + Shift + Space) for long dictations.
- **Works everywhere**: Slack, Gmail, Docs, your IDE, anything with a text cursor. Focus never leaves the app you are typing in.
- **Live overlay**: a small floating meter shows your real waveform, a timer, and the result (word count or a readable error), then gets out of the way.
- **Smart formatting**: a fast LLM strips filler words, fixes punctuation and casing, and honors spoken commands like "new paragraph". It fails open: if formatting hiccups, you still get the raw transcript.
- **Custom dictionary**: names, brands, and acronyms spelled your way, hinted to Whisper and enforced by the formatter.
- **Local history**: your last 200 dictations, stored only on your machine, with copy and delete.
- **Low cost by design**: Groq's free tier covers normal daily use. Heavy use costs about $0.04 per hour of speech. A local Whisper server drops in for $0.

## Quick start (from source)

Prerequisites: [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org) and a microphone.

```powershell
git clone <this repo>
cd murmur
npm install
npm start
```

First launch opens a three-step setup: paste a key, allow the mic, try it. That's it. Murmur then lives in your system tray.

## Get a free Groq key

1. Go to [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com) and sign up (free, no card).
2. Open **API Keys**, create a key, copy it.
3. Paste it into Murmur's setup screen, or later under Settings, Voice & model.

The key is stored only on your machine, in `%APPDATA%\murmur\settings.json`, and is sent only as the auth header to the API you configure.

## Using it

| Action | Default |
|---|---|
| Hold to talk | Hold **Right Ctrl**, release to insert |
| Toggle recording | **Ctrl + Shift + Space** |
| Cancel while recording | **Esc** |
| Settings / History | Tray icon menu |

Both keys are rebindable in Settings, General.

## Costs, and how to run it free

| Option | Cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Groq free tier (default) | $0 | Generous daily allowance, plenty for normal dictation |
| Groq paid | ~$0.04 per hour of audio | whisper-large-v3-turbo; even heavy daily use is pennies per month |
| Local Whisper server | $0 | Fully offline and private, see below |
| OpenAI Whisper API | ~$0.36 per hour | Works by changing Base URL + model, 9x Groq's price |

Smart formatting uses `llama-3.1-8b-instant` on Groq, which is effectively free at dictation volumes. Turning Smart formatting off removes that call entirely.

**Going fully local**: run any OpenAI-compatible Whisper server, for example [speaches](https://github.com/speaches-ai/speaches) or faster-whisper-server, then in Settings, Voice & model, Advanced set Base URL to your server (like `http://localhost:8000/v1`) and pick your local model name. Nothing leaves your machine.

## Privacy

- Audio is sent only to the API you configured, only while you are dictating, and is not stored by Murmur anywhere.
- History and settings live in `%APPDATA%\murmur\` and never leave your machine. History can be turned off.
- Insertion uses the clipboard for a moment. Note that Windows Clipboard History (Win + V), if you have it enabled, may keep a copy of transcripts like anything else you copy.
- No analytics, no telemetry, no accounts.

## Troubleshooting

**"Microphone blocked"**: Windows Settings, Privacy & security, Microphone: turn on "Let desktop apps access your microphone".

**Hold-to-talk shows unavailable**: the global key hook (uiohook-napi) failed to load on your machine. The toggle shortcut still works. Re-running `npm install` usually fixes it.

**Nothing pastes into a specific app**: some apps block synthetic paste. Switch Settings, General, Insertion method to "Type it out" for those.

**Toggle shortcut does nothing**: another app owns that combo. Rebind it in Settings, General.

**SmartScreen warning on the portable .exe**: expected for unsigned internal tools. Click "More info", then "Run anyway", or run from source instead.

## For coworkers without Node

Someone on the team can run `npm run dist` and hand you `release/Murmur-<version>-portable.exe`. Double-click it, no install, no admin rights.

## For developers

```
src/main/       app lifecycle, tray, hotkeys, transcription, insertion
src/preload/    contextBridge APIs (renderers are fully sandboxed)
src/renderer/   overlay pill + settings window (vanilla HTML/CSS/JS)
scripts/        gen-icons.js writes every icon from code (no binary assets)
prd.json        the product spec: stories with acceptance criteria
```

- `npm run smoke` boots every subsystem headlessly and prints `SMOKE_RESULT` JSON.
- `npm run dist` builds a portable .exe and an NSIS installer into `release/`.
- Development follows `prd.json`: each story has acceptance criteria and a `passes` flag. Do not mark a story passing until every criterion is verified.

## Architecture in one paragraph

An Electron tray app. The main process owns hotkeys (Electron `globalShortcut` for the toggle, `uiohook-napi` keydown/keyup for hold-to-talk), a transparent click-through overlay window, and a state machine (idle, listening, processing). The overlay renderer owns the microphone: MediaRecorder captures webm/opus while an AnalyserNode drives the waveform. Audio goes to `{baseUrl}/audio/transcriptions` (Groq Whisper by default), optionally through `{baseUrl}/chat/completions` for cleanup, then text is inserted by a persistent PowerShell SendKeys helper via clipboard swap + Ctrl+V, and the clipboard is restored. No native build tools are needed anywhere: the only native module ships prebuilt binaries.
